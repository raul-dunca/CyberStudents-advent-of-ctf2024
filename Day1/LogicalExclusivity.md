For this challenge I used CyberChef, after trying different things and given the name of the challenge I tried the following recipe on the hex strings:

In the output I observed something that looked like a flag: `kal{pCu8t3_8391Vv1V95_858L48}` when `key = 0f`. But the flag did not start with `csd{` as it is supposed to, so I tried `ROT13 Brute Force` from CyberChef. I also checked the `Rotate numbers` setting but that didnâ€™t yield the correct flag, so use it without that setting:
