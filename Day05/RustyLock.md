I started by putting the binary and the pdb file in the same folder and opened the exe file in binary ninja. Found the `CrackMe::validate_password` function and relabeled symbols to get an understanding of what is happening. There are 5 checks done:

1) password length must be 12
2) first digit must be even
3) sum of the digits should be 69
4) the password must contain a substring from the variable `pat`, which is a substring of: `YellowsGreenBlueRedOrangePurplesrc\\main.rs`
5) last digit is odd

Here is the relabeled function in binary ninja:

For the 4th condition, it is possible to find exactly which substring from `pat` must be included in the password, but I didn’t check the function in detail because it seems like a lot of work. I assumed there is some kind of slicing being done. Knowing this information, I just burteforced the 4th condition. Ignoring that condition for now, I crafted this string: `8XXXX7999999`, which respects the other four conditions. Now, I just replaced `XXXX` with a different substring of `YellowsGreenBlueRedOrangePurplesrc\\main.rs` until `8eRed7999999` gave the flag.
