I started by using Google Images and I discovered this post:

<img src="https://github.com/raul-dunca/CyberStudents-advent-of-ctf2024/blob/main/.assets/day_20_info.png">

Which told me the location. I also saw an article about picnic areas, and because of the wall in the picture, I used the following search query in Google Maps: `Picnic Area Red Rock National Conservation Area`. I then found `Red Rock Canyon Overlook` and tried to find the approximate spot from where the picture was taken.
