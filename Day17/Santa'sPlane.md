From the 2 pictures provided, the first thing I notice was the name and the title `Cpl Kenneth P. Sm...`. I initially tried using this to find the plane but didn't have any luck. Then I focused on the fact that it is a cargo plane, and it should be a military one since `Cpl` is a military rank.
So, I used [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_transport_aircraft) Wikipedia link and I searched for images of each plane's interior and tried to find a mach. I also think that the organizers are from the US, so I looked at the US planes first and I found it.
